# Using YOLOv8 For Predictor

## Overview
This project utilizes YOLOv8 for object detection and prediction. YOLOv8 is a state-of-the-art object detection model that can be used for a variety of applications including image classification, object detection, and more.

## Features
- **Object Detection:** Detects objects in images with high accuracy.
- **Custom Models:** Supports custom models for different types of object detection tasks.
- **Real-time Prediction:** Provides real-time prediction capabilities.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- YOLOv8 library
- Other dependencies (e.g., `opencv-python`, `numpy`, etc.)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Download and set up YOLOv8 models as per your requirement.

## Usage
1. **Prepare Your Images:** Place your images in the designated input folder.

2. **Run the Prediction:**
    ```bash
    python predict.py --model <path-to-model> --source <path-to-images>
    ```

3. **Check Results:** The predicted results will be saved in the output folder.

## Configuration
- **Model Path:** Path to the YOLOv8 model file.
- **Source Path:** Path to the folder containing images for prediction.
- **Output Path:** Path where the results will be saved.
